After working in the legal industry for 18 years, I wanted to know which US offices make the most revenue and whether more attorneys equal more profit.

I used the list of the largest law firms by revenue from a 2022 ranking on Wikipedia.

Then I used each firm's website to get a headcount of attorneys for each US location. 

I calculated each office's headcount by revenue per attorney and displayed the data in a couple of visualizations in POWER BI.
